* installing arch dot txt

  i am so sorry for this guide.

  [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ejmg/an-idiots-guide-to-installing-arch-on-a-lenovo-carbon-x1-gen-6/master/dumb-pic-2.jpeg]]

  this is an attempt at a comprehensive, start to finish, install guide for
  lenovo's 6th gen carbon x1. my model is the 20KG-0022US, which I bought from
  costco, and comes with an 8th gen intel i7, 16gb ram, and 512gb ssd. My
  instructions will thus have mentions of specific components from this
  laptops as they appear in the guide, but i will try to make it clear when
  such a case may not hold for others with respect to 6th gen x1 versions.

  i want to make a shoutout to specific sources for informing this guide. it's
  the result of mashing together and cross referencing the wiki with multiple
  guides where I would verify instructions and install strategies. Included in
  this list is [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQKHvKbmSzGMvUrVtJYnUA][LearnLinux.tv]], [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNgMPxqWds9IYR_QFNPButw][Kai Hendry]], [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNgMPxqWds9IYR_QFNPButw][Lucas Alvares Gomes]], [[https://ticki.github.io/blog/setting-up-archlinux-on-a-lenovo-yoga/][Ticki]], [[https://kozikow.com/2016/06/03/installing-and-configuring-arch-linux-on-thinkpad-x1-carbon/#Disable-secure-boot][Robert
  Kozikowski]], and [[https://delta-xi.net][Erik Sonnleitner]]. ya'll helped a homie get arch working on
  this kickass computer.

* why you should or should not install arch
  1. Pros
     - you can learn a small bit about how linux and operating systems work
     - very up to date software
     - access to things like AUR
     - run a very lightweight system that, outside of even more niche and
       esoteric operating systems, avoids bloat and waste
     - want something extremely sad and nerdy to """brag about""" (don't do this)
  2. Cons
     - my friend Chris Allen made a [[https://github.com/ejmg/an-idiots-guide-to-installing-arch-on-a-lenovo-carbon-x1-gen-6/pull/3][PR wiping the entire fucking guide]] and
       simply suggesting you Don't Install Arch
       - the man has a /solid/ point
     - it can take a lot of time to get going
       - this is assuming your hardware (non X1C6) is well supported or
         doesn't have some proprietary code that throws you into kernel h e l l
       - you could equally do something better with your time, like sleep,
         call your mom, or, idk, hangout with friends if you have those.
       - not proud of this, but it took me like 8 hours to get it all right
         for the first time. i'm an idiot, though. ergo, /idiot's guide/
     - it has the most up to date packages, which translates to instability
       and things breaking more often
       - if you do software, this is actually something you often don't want
         outside of maybe what you work on the most.
     - ricing
       - this is just the time point again
       - but really, what good does it serve you to be constantly tweaking your
         configurations and init files and thus constantly having to fix them
       - arch doesn't actually require that, but it is so tempting to do and
         thus a danger

* disclaimer (sacrifices, incantations, don't sue me, etc.)
  since we are installing arch, there a a few precautions you'll want to
  take/keep in mind:
  1. if your shit gets destroyed, it is 1000% not my problem and not my fault
    lmao
    - that said, that's an extremely unlikely outcome, please don't let this
      liability bulletpoint scare you
  2. you may want to form a pentagram with some usb cords, placing a copy of
    the GNU GPLv3 license at its center, and playing some soft but slightly
    erotic ambient music so that we may pray to stallman that this goes
    smoothly

    [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ejmg/an-idiots-guide-to-installing-arch-on-a-lenovo-carbon-x1-gen-6/master/stallman-dot-png.jpg][st. ignucius, may he guide us]]

  3. put aside like 2-4 hours for this depending on how inexperienced you are
    - just keep this in mind and or be somewhere you can stop and leave your laptop
      plugged in on the chance you need to do something else
* live usb
  1. download the img from https://www.archlinux.org/download/
     - torrent is faster, also remember to seed
     - alternatively just dl the iso directly, slightly slower
  2. install
     - find your usb
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         lsblk
       #+END_SRC
       - it will probably be named ~sda~ or ~sdb~, pay attention to the size
         of the drives upon output to be sure.
       - you are going to use the name of the drive itself, ~sdx~, so *do not* include
         a number, such as ~sdx1~ in the drive name for the command below
       - make sure it is unmounted with:
         #+BEGIN_SRC 
           umount /dev/sdx # x = letter of your actual drive
         #+END_SRC
     - in term:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         dd bs=4M if=/path/to/iso of=/path/to/usb status=progress oflag=sync
       #+END_SRC
     - example in my case:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         dd bs=4M if=~/Downloads/archlinux-2018.07.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sda status=progress oflag=sync
       #+END_SRC
       - *note*: I did this on Ubuntu with Gnome, and it proved not possible
         to format it with the drive entirely unmounted because of how
         Nautillus handles mounting jump drives. Therefore, I actually did
         this with it mounted but had no problems so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
         linux ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ymmv ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
     - upon finishing, insert the usb into the x1
  3. disable safe boot
     - turn on laptop (or hard reset to ensure true "turn off"), press enter
       at lenovo boot screen
     - under Security, you will find the option. Disable it.
  4. (optional) enable Thunerbolt BIOS Assist Mode
     - this effects the process of enabling S3, which is something at the very
       end of this guide
       - if you are going to do that, it saves you a reboot (and it doesn't
         effect you really either way)
     - You will find the option under Config
  5. ensure your usb is first in boot order
     - under Startup, go to boot
     - using the ~-~ and ~+~ keys, make sure it is at the top of the list
       - I had to use ~Shift~ while pressing ~+~ for it to affect
     - press ~F10~ to save our configs and exit.
         
  If everything went well, we will now boot into the arch iso. 

* setting up to install
  you are going to need to be familiar with vim, nano, pico, emacs, idc,
  something, this is on you, fam.

** configure our mirrors to download software from
      - this is the difference between a 20kb/s and ~10mb/s download speed, at
        least in my case first time round
      - the mirror list is found in ~/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist~
        - the logic is simple: the earlier a mirror item appears in the list,
          the greater preference it is given for use as a source.
      - copy and paste a server that is close to you geographically and insert
        it at the top of the list.
        - server i chose for those in USA who are lazy:
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
            Server = http://mirrors.lug.mtu.edu/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
          #+END_SRC
      - *important* refresh our mirrorlist
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          pacman -Sy
        #+END_SRC
        - we will now have (hopefully) fast downloads for our packages
** configure wifi ("optional")
      1. x1 does not have a ether port, but adaptors exist
         - these adaptors supposedly work without issue but I don't have one,
           so I'm assuming you don't either
         - dilemma: we don't have fucking internet by default
         - solution: ~netctl~
      2. find the name of your wifi card device
         - I would assume x1's have the same name, but who knows:
           #+BEGIN_SRC sh
             ip link
           #+END_SRC
         - mine was ~wlp2s0~, arch wiki suggests that anything that starts with
           a ~w~ is probably the wifi card
      3. figure out the wifi point you are going to use.
         - I'm going to assume it is either of "simple" wpa or wpa-enterprise
           - the latter is at corporate or university settings if that helps
           - luckily ~netctl~ provides templates for both. copy the appropriate
             one and place it in the root of ~netctl~ as so:
             #+BEGIN_SRC sh
               # simple wpa, such as home routers
               cp /etc/netctl/examples/wireless-wpa /etc/netctl/<NAME-YOU-WANT-TO-GIVE-IT>

               # enterprise wpa
               cp /etc/netctl/examples/wireless-wpa-configsection /etc/netctl/<NAME-YOU-WANT-TO-GIVE-IT>
             #+END_SRC
           - ~wireless-wpa~ looks like this:
             #+BEGIN_SRC conf
               Description='A simple WPA encrypted wireless connection'
               Interface=wlan0
               Connection=wireless

               Security=wpa
               IP=dhcp

               ESSID='MyNetwork'
               # Prepend hexadecimal keys with \"
               # If your key starts with ", write it as '""<key>"'
               # See also: the section on special quoting rules in netctl.profile(5)
               Key='WirelessKey'
               # Uncomment this if your ssid is hidden
               #Hidden=yes
               # Set a priority for automatic profile selection
               #Priority=10
             #+END_SRC
           - ~wireless-wpa-configsection~ looks like this:
             #+BEGIN_SRC conf
               Description='A wireless connection using a custom network block configuration'
               Interface=wlan0
               Connection=wireless
               Security=wpa-configsection
               IP=dhcp
               WPAConfigSection=(
                   'ssid="University"'
                   'key_mgmt=WPA-EAP'
                   'eap=TTLS'
                   'group=TKIP'
                   'pairwise=TKIP CCMP'
                   'anonymous_identity="anonymous"'
                   'identity="myusername"'
                   'password="mypassword"'
                   'priority=1'
                   'phase2="auth=PAP"'
               )
             #+END_SRC
           - *in both cases*:
             - ~Interface~ takes the value of the wifi card device name we
               found earlier
             - ~Security~, ~Connection~, and ~IP~ remain untouched
             - Do what you will with ~Description~
           - For vanilla ~wireless-wpa~, the config explains itself:
             - ~ESSID~ is the name of your wifi access point
             - ~Key~ is the password
           - For ~wireless-wpa-configsection~, things can be trickier:
             - ~ssid~ is access point
             - ~key_mgmt~ should remain untouched in most cases
             - ~eap~ is entirely dependent on your case, for many (aka
               including me), it is ~PEAP~
             - ~pairwise~ is dependent on your situation (i did not need it)
             - ~anonymous_identity~ is dependent on your situation (i did not need it)
             - ~password~ is password
             - ~priority~ is dependent on your situation (i did not need it)
             - ~phase2~ is dependent on your situation (i did not need it)
             - if my list appears not very useful in terms of help and
               explanation, then you understand the very nature of who is
               writing it and i'm so sorry i'm trying
             - example ~wireless-wpa-configsection~ i actually used (with
               values obviously substituted in):
               #+BEGIN_SRC conf
                 Description='lol'
                 Interface=wlp2s0
                 Connection=wireless
                 Security=wpa-configsection
                 IP=dhcp
                 WPAConfigSection=(
                     'ssid="wutang"'
                     'key_mgmt=WPA-EAP'
                     'eap=PEAP'
                     'identity="ghostfacekillah"'
                     'password="suuuuuuuuuuuuu69"'
                 )
               #+END_SRC
      4. save your config file, time to connect:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
           netctl start <NAME-OF-YOUR-WIFI-PROFILE>
         #+END_SRC
         - it should take like 3 seconds to connect
         - if nothing happens, it worked
         - check with a quick ~ping 8.8.8.8~, if packets are shooting out, you
           got internet.
           - otherwise, diagnose with ~journalctl -xe~ and use those arch wikis
             and forums! welcome to arch :) :) :) :)
** debugging advise:
         - i did not run into this during install time, but when i later
           tried to connect to wifi, a few different commands came in handy
           to debug my situation:
           1. stop previous connection
              - can't have more than one ~netctl~ service going, so:
                #+BEGIN_SRC sh
                  netctl stop <PROFILE>
                #+END_SRC

           2. systemctl fuckery
              - systemctl sometimes gets in the way with its service/handling
                of netctl, stop it
                #+BEGIN_SRC sh
                  systemctl stop netctl@<PROFILE>.service
                #+END_SRC

           3. ip link may have your services as ~up~, put them as ~down~
              - ~netctl~ does not like it when your link is up before it runs,
                so turn it off:
                #+BEGIN_SRC sh
                  ip link set <INTERFACE> down
                #+END_SRC
* freeze: partition time!
  that was a bad joke jesus christ forgive me 
** make sure we have (U)EFI
   - i am doing all of this on the *presumption we have EFI*, maybe
     should have brought that up while we were in BIOS
   - use the following command to ensure we are in EFI mode:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       ls /sys/firmware/efi/
     #+END_SRC
     - *if the directory exists, we are good*
** figure out where our main drive is
   - find our drives with ~lsblk~ yet again
     - my x1 came with a PCIe ssd, yours may or may not and, more
       importantly, this influences its name as seen with ~lsblk~ (i think)
       - for the PCIe ssd, it will be called something like ~nvme0n1~, with
         each partition appending a ~p1~, ~p2~, and so forth
       - for others, it may appear as the traditional ~sda~, with a number
         appended for each partition as it did above for your usb stick.
       - will assume we are using ~nvme0n1~ as our os drive hereon
     - my x1 came with windows installed and i assumed yours did, too.
       - i am going to kill windows with this install.
         - cannot have an optimally secure setup otherwise (or rather, I'm
           not going to put up with that much of a headache).
       - if you want to keep a dual boot setup, this is not the guide for you.
       - i am sorry to fail you like this, my kings and queens. f.
** partitioning and configuring
   1. we will now format our main drive with arch
      #+BEGIN_SRC 
        gdisk /dev/nvme0n1
      #+END_SRC
      - you will enter a prompt of sorts for gdisk 
      - you should get some output about a valid GPT partition found
         alongside with a protected MBR partition. This is good.
   2. we will now wipe the disk.
      - *this is permanent. stop now or forever hold your peace*
      - I will be listing the commands in order and describe what they do
        as subpoints:
        - ~o~
          - we are wiping the disk. answer ~y~ to continue.
        - ~n~
          - command for making a new partition.
        - ~Enter~
          - we want the default number for the partition, and this
            convention will hold throughout the rest of the guide.
        - ~Enter~
          - we don't want to specify the starting vector for the partition,
            and this convention will hold throughout the rest of the
            guide.
        - ~+512MB~
          - we want our first partition to be of size 512MB. This is to
            meet the specification for a EFI boot partition.
        - ~EF00~
          - this is the hex code type to indicate we want the partition to
            be of EFI
          - *partition 1 done*
        - ~n~
          - making another partition
        - ~Enter~
        - ~Enter~
        - ~Enter~
          - the final partition is going to take the rest of our disk. If
            you do not want this, assign it something else like we did
            above.
        - ~8E00~
          - this is the linux LVM (logical volume manager) format, which we
            are going to need for our encryption scheme.
          - *second partition done*
          - we are now done making /physical/ partitions
        - ~w~
          - *we are going to write to disk*
        - ~y~
          - *we just wrote to disk. goodbye everything else*
* encryption and mounting
** encryption with ~cryptsetup~
      - make sure to use our *second partition*
        - *not* our EFI partition
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
            # in my case, this is...
            cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2
          #+END_SRC
        - you will be prompted for a password, make it a good one
        - we do not specify the luks type, such as ~luks2~, because it is
          incompatible with GRUB. We will not be using GRUB, but I do not
          want to screw myself (or you) out of that option.
          - for the love of god, do not forget this password
          - this process could take like 2 or 3 or 4 hours depending on
            your experience and the last thing you need to do is forget the
            fucking luks password.
        - what we have now is a Luks container, which we will be using to
          put our actual OS/data in, which makes handling encryption logic
          easier in the long run.
** generation of logical volumes within our LVM
      1. open our encrypted container:
         - we need to name the container, I am choosing ~main_part~ for main
           partition, it really doesn't matter
           #+BEGIN_SRC sh
             cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/nmve0n1p2 main_part
           #+END_SRC
         - this should now be available at ~/dev/mapper/main_part~
      2. create a physical volume within our LVM partition:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
           pvcreate /dev/mapper/main_part
         #+END_SRC
         - this creates a "physical" volume inside of our luks container
      3. create a volume group
         - we need to name this one, I'm choosing ~main_group~ to continue
           the theme
         - this will go on "top" of our physical container we just made, ergo
           why we create our group from it.
           #+BEGIN_SRC sh
             vgcreate main_group /dev/mapper/main_part
           #+END_SRC
      4. generate our logical partitions within the luks container

         I am following the wiki piece for piece here, and what you ultimately
         make the size of your swap (if any), root, and home (if any) is
         completely your call. The numbers I use are pulled from thin air and
         because I have so much space to use with the ssd that came with my
         x1.

         Note that for each instance, we are taking our logical partition from
         the volume group we just created. *Be conscious of this*.

         1. create swap:
            #+BEGIN_SRC sh
              # 8 gb for swap
              lvcreate -L8G main_group -n swap
            #+END_SRC
         2. create root
            #+BEGIN_SRC sh
              # 8 gb for swap
              lvcreate -L64G main_group -n root
            #+END_SRC
         3. create home
            #+BEGIN_SRC sh
              lvcreate -l 100%FREE main_group -n home
            #+END_SRC
            - we use a special trick to allocate all remaining memory in our
              ssd to home. it goes without saying that do not do this if you
              do not want to allocate all of it to home, etc.
** format and mount our logical partitions

      Note that our resultant logical volumes are named
      ~<VOLUME_GROUP_NAME>-<root|home|swap>~, so my home is
      ~/dev/mapper/main_group-home~ for example.

      1. root and home:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
           mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/main_group-root
           mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/main_group-home
         #+END_SRC

      2. swap:
         #+BEGIN_SRC 
           mkswap /dev/mapper/main_group-swap
         #+END_SRC

      3. mount our new volumes

         1. mount our new volumes
             
            The logic here is that ~/mnt/~ translates to ~/~ for our actual
            arch system once we install arch, so keep this in
            mind. ~/mnt/boot~ becomes ~/boot/~, ~/mnt/home/~ becomes home,
            etcetera. 
            #+BEGIN_SRC sh
              mount /dev/mapper/main_group-root /mnt/
              mkdir /mnt/home
              mount /dev/mapper/main_group-home /mnt/home
              swapon /dev/mapper/main_group-swap
            #+END_SRC

         2. mount our bootloader
             
            Remember the first partition we made (~nvme0n1p1~ in my case)? We
            now need to mount it as the boot loader:
            #+BEGIN_SRC sh
              mkdir /mnt/boot/
              mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot
            #+END_SRC
* installing arch and setting it up to boot and run
** install arch onto ~/mnt~
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacstrap /mnt/ base   
   #+END_SRC
   - note, a popular additional option to include is ~base-devel~, so
      install that as well if you see yourself needing to compile and link
      a lot of things, such as through AUR. 
   - *CONGRATS!*
     - you have installed arch!
   - *CONGRATS!*
     - you are not even remotely close to done installing arch!
     - it won't even boot correctly as of now!
     - welcome to arch :~)
** generate our fstab file
   - this is important for boot loading purposes, not the last time you will
     deal with this. It holds information about partitions, can't say much
     more about this.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       genfstab -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
     #+END_SRC
** log into arch and installing stuff!
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
     archroot /mnt
   #+END_SRC

   we are now in the arch install and no longer "in" the live usb, fyi. let's
   get to work then:
   1. installing important packages
      - we have access to things, like wifi, that are not yet actually
        configured yet on the operating system, thus we should take advantage
        of this by installing some packages.
        - some of these are subjective, others are ones I have taken from people
          who know more about arch than I do
   2. for a fact will want to install all the packages in relation to wifi
      if you do not have an adapter like me.
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        pacman -S wpa_supplicant networkmanager network-manager-applet dialogue 
      #+END_SRC
   3. packages for intel microcode drivers, *important*
      - microcode is key to stability and patching issues with intel
        processors that is released as proprietary code. The linux kernal
        can do this directly for us.
      - need to modify ~/etc/pacman.conf~
      - it will have two lines commented out regarding ~multilib, uncomment
        them as so:
        #+BEGIN_SRC conf
          [multilib]
          Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
        #+END_SRC
      - now install intel microcode:
        #+BEGIN_SRC 
          pacman -Sy intel-ucode
        #+END_SRC
   4. other packages others recommend:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        pacman -S linux-headers linux-lts linux-lts-headers
      #+END_SRC
      - we are essentially installing another copy of the linux kernal for
        purposes of stability: if something goes wrong with an update of the
        kernal, you will have a backup kernal to get into.
      - additionally, we are installing the headers for both the current
        kernal and the lts kernal: these are useful for other packages that
        need to link/bind against them for development purposes, etc.
   5. we install another useful operating system:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        pacman -S emacs
      #+END_SRC
      - .... or vim if that's your choice.... definitely more efficient
        memory wise
      - c.f. i will /die/ before i give up my elisp
      - you should probably also install tools like ~git~
** modify ~/etc/mkinitcpio.conf~ to enable encryption
   1. there is a variable in here named ~HOOKS~, which the file makes clear
     is important to the boot order of the operating system.
      - make yours look like this:
        #+BEGIN_SRC conf
          HOOKS=(base udev autodetect keyboard keymap modconf block encrypt lvm2 filesystems fsck)
        #+END_SRC
        - you will notice that we *moved* ~keyboard~ to after ~autodetect~
        - *added* ~keymap~ to after ~keyboard~
        - *added* ~encrypt~ and ~lvm2~ after ~block~ and before ~filesystems~
        - *do not fuck this up*
   2. regenerate our ~initramfs~:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        mkinitcpio -p linux
      #+END_SRC
      - we regenerate the image of the operating system here
      - it now takes into account the new boot items and order we have
        specified in the ~HOOKS~ variable
   3. *if you installed* the ~linux-lts~ kernal, you have to *do it again* for that
      as well
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        mkinitcpio -p linux-lts
      #+END_SRC
      - _we are getting there, lads, hold on. for the promise land is close._
** setting up the bootloader itself
   I am using bootctl, not grub. Your call to make ultimately.

   1. create our loader with bootctl
      #+BEGIN_SRC 
        bootctl --path=/boot/ install
      #+END_SRC
   2. create arch loader
      - modify the file ~/boot/loader.conf~ to reflect the following:
        #+BEGIN_SRC conf
          default arch
          timeout 3
          editor 0 
        #+END_SRC
        - ~default~ is the default entry to select when booting
        - ~timeout~ is the time before the entry is loaded at the boot menu
        - ~editor~ is whether to enable the the kernal parameters
          editor. This is import to disable for security purpose and is
          *enabled by default, so make sure to disable as above*
   3. create arch.conf
      1. you are going to need a variable value provided by the command
         ~blkid~
         - you will either need to write it down by hand to copy with nano
           or use ~emacs~ or ~vim~ to evaluate it in buffer to copy
           - emacs has ~eshell~, which you can use like the normal shell but
             copy and paste with
           - vim has the command ~:r !blkid~ which will read in the file
             directly
         - this variable is the ~UUID~ for ~/dev/nvme0n1p2~ as given from ~blkid~
           - ~/dev/nvme0n1p2~ is the second physical partition we made at the
             very beginning. If yours is ~/dev/sda2~ or similar, use that
             instead.
           - you will know it is the correct entry if the line also includes
             ~TYPE="crypto_LUKS" PARTLABEL="Linux LVM"~
         - example:
           #+BEGIN_SRC conf
             /dev/nvme0n1p2: UUID="really-long-string-of-alphanumericals" TYPE="crypto_LUKS" PARTLABEL="Linux LVM" PARTUUID="another-long-string-of-alphanumericals"
           #+END_SRC
           - note: we want the value of ~UUID~, *NOT* ~PARTUUID~ or
             anything else.
      2. with this value copied, create the file
         ~/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf~:
         #+BEGIN_SRC conf
           title Arch Linux
           linux /vmlinuz-linux # not a typo
           initrd /intel-ucode.img # this must come before the entry immediately below
           initrd /initramfs-linux.img # what we made with mkinitcpio -p linux
           options cryptdevice=UUID=long-alphanumerica-string-WITHOUT-QUOTES:cryptlvm root=/dev/mapper/main_group-root quiet rw
         #+END_SRC
         - as i try to hint, make sure to remove the quotes around the UUID
           value as copied and pasted
         - note that we add a ~:cryptlvm~ to the end of that value
         - after a single space, we added the location of our root
           partition within the luks container,
           ~root=/dev/mapper/main_group-root/~ in my case
         - finally, we add the options ~quiet rw~
** reboot and start arch
   - From here, we can *officially reboot into our install and it should work*
     - 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
     - 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
   - execute ~shutdown now~
     - remove the usb once the laptop turns off
     - you should eventually see the boot screen which will automatically
       boot into arch after 2 seconds or so
   - enter your password for the encrypted partition when asked, then login
     as ~root~ and press enter for the password, seeing as we have yet to
     make one.
* drivers, wifi, sudo user
    
  .... we aren't done yet :~) 🎉🎉🎉
** utilities   
   1. wifi
      - i hope you installed those wifi packages i told you to install and or
        you have a lan connection
      - refollow the steps we did above for wifi to regain our connection
   2. reconfigure our mirror list
      - again, do as we did before with ~/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist~
   3. configure locale.gen and time
      1. enter ~/etc/locale.gen~
         - we need to tell arch what our locale is by going to the line and
           uncommenting our respective locale
           - usa peeps will use the line ~en_US.UTF-8 UTF8~
      2. run ~locale-gen~
      3. run ~localectl set-locale LANG="en_US.UTF-8"~
         - this is separate from step 2.
         - some applications need it because they won't respect the changes
           brought by step #2
      4. sync our clock with ~hwclock --systohc --utc~
   4. change password for root with ~passwd~
      - self explanatory, but know this is the password exclusively for
        ~root~, not for your own user you'll make later who will have sudo
        user privileges.
   5. as of now, you will have to manually connect to wifi access points.
      - tools like ~wifi-menu~ help you find access points
      - it will also help you make a config for it. even if the initial
        connection attempt fails, preserve the config (it'll ask you) and go
        in to edit it. ~wifi-menu~ will then be able to use the corrected
        config the next time you try.
** touchpad, xorg, and graphics drivers
   I am choosing to not use wayland because while it is the future of linux
   desktop management, it is still not 100% ready for userland.

   1. touchpad install
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        pacman -S xf86-input-libinput
      #+END_SRC
   2. xorg
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit xorg-apps mesa xterm
      #+END_SRC
      - we need xterm in addition to xorg if we want to have a minimally
        functional deskto a la ~twm~ windows manager that xorg default
        supports

   3. intel drivers
      - to my knowledge, we only have 32 bit drivers in case you are
        wondering why we are instaling 32 bit drivers /shrug 
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          pacman -S xf86-video-intel lib32-intel-dri lib32-mesa lib32-libgl
        #+END_SRC
      - at this point, if you want, you can use a very primitive GUI via
        ~twm~, which is the default tiling window manager of xorg. To do
        this, simply run ~startx~. If it looks weird and ugly, it worked.
        - personally, i'm going to stay in the default tty shell.
** configuring sudo, adding a user, disabling root   
   1. install ~sudo~
      - i am not joking, arch does not come with ~sudo~ by default
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          pacman -S sudo
        #+END_SRC

   2. enable sudo for other users via ~visudo~
      - it is bad to edit the sudoers file with a normal editor. ~visudo~
        makes a temporary file and checks that any edits are
        syntactically correct before saving and affecting the changes.
      - we need to uncomment the following line:
      #+BEGIN_SRC shell
        ## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
        # %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL # <-- this line if its now clear enough, fam
      #+END_SRC
      - make sure to not uncomment the one after this one, they have
        somewhat similar contents but are not the same ofc
      - visudo uses vi by *default*. If you do not know how to use vi,
        simply execute the following to use nano instead:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          EDITOR=nano visudo
        #+END_SRC
   3. creating new user
      - make your actual user account with the following, substituting
        your desired name:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash <NAME>
        #+END_SRC
      - give your new user a password
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          passwd <NAME>
        #+END_SRC
      - reboot (or just exit, but I like being sure) your machine, and
        make sure you can login as your new user.
        - *this is critical before we disable root*
          - otherwise risk not being to log back in
   4. disable root login
      - you don't have to do this, but I think it is a good security
        practice to have
        - makes it much much harder to get into your machine by making
          adversaries guess the username itself in addition to 
        - if you are enabling ssh, i believe this does not effect that,
          so make sure to disable root logins via ssh as well.
      - as your new user, simple execute:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          sudo passwd -l root
        #+END_SRC
        - exit and retry to login as root, should no longer be able to
          - it'll show "login incorrect" errors even when using the
            correct password for root user
* loose ends: desktop stuff, etc
** desktop environment
   still not done :~)

   we will go for kde5 plasma for now because it is absolutely gorgeous, is not
   bloated, and is easy to get accustomed to. i may possibly add an addendum
   for a tiling wm like dwm if I can get it figured out.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     pacman -S plasma-meta kde-applications # don't do the last if you don't want kde apps, i do, though.
   #+END_SRC
   - this might take a quick minute given the total DL is about ~3gb iirc

   now we need to enable it by creating a ~.xinitrc~ file in our home with the
   following content:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     echo "exec startkde" >> .xinitrc
   #+END_SRC

   to use your beautiful new desktop, simply execute ~startx~ and KDE should
   now load. Nice!
   - whenever you reboot your laptop, you will need to execute ~startx~ to get
     your desktop. If you don't want the hassle, then put this in your ~.profile~
     once you know your desktop starts as expected with ~startx~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       if [[ ! $DISPLAY && $XDG_VTNR -eq 1 ]]; then
         exec startx
       fi
     #+END_SRC
     - more stuff on customizing xorg startup: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinit
*** kde discover
    - KDE discover is the DE's app store. It won't work fully by default
      because of how arch handles its applications. You need to install the
      following for it to work as expected:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        pacman -S packagekit-qt5
      #+END_SRC
      - you may still get an error about ~parley.knsrc~, from what I can tell
        and searching online, this is """harmless""".
** fonts
   fonts, and how they work, is actually one of the more confusing things i
   encountered during this journey
     - partitioning drives and encrypting them makes much more sense vs font
       configurations in retrospect
       - the following should help you get some very nice looking fonts on your
         computer along with full emoji support more or less
       - completely ripped from a reddit post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/5r5ep8/make_your_arch_fonts_beautiful_easily/][here]]

     - install the fonts

       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         pacman -S ttf-dejavu ttf-liberation noto-fonts
       #+END_SRC

     - enable font presets

       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         sudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-no-bitmaps.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d
         sudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-sub-pixel-rgb.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d
         sudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/11-lcdfilter-default.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d
       #+END_SRC

     - create a file, ~/etc/fonts/local.conf~ with following:
        
       #+BEGIN_SRC html
           <?xml version="1.0"?>
           <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
           <fontconfig>
               <match>
                   <edit mode="prepend" name="family"><string>Noto Sans</string></edit>
               </match>
               <match target="pattern">
                   <test qual="any" name="family"><string>serif</string></test>
                   <edit name="family" mode="assign" binding="same"><string>Noto Serif</string></edit>
               </match>
               <match target="pattern">
                   <test qual="any" name="family"><string>sans-serif</string></test>
                   <edit name="family" mode="assign" binding="same"><string>Noto Sans</string></edit>
               </match>
               <match target="pattern">
                   <test qual="any" name="family"><string>monospace</string></test>
                   <edit name="family" mode="assign" binding="same"><string>Noto Mono</string></edit>
               </match>
           </fontconfig>
       #+END_SRC

     - then go to Fonts (use KDE's search bar, accessible via the bottom left
       button on the desktop panel), and make sure the edits are reflected
       there, i.e. that you now have Noto Sans as your font for everything
       minus fixed width text, which should be Hack.

     - you can do more edits to tweak fonts to your liking here.

     - resetting the computer should make sure the edits take full effect
       across all apps, etc.

** emacs
   1. ispell doesn't work by default because the required programs aren't
      installed. let's fix that:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        pacman -S aspell-en # ispell didn't work for some reason, so we use its successor.
      #+END_SRC
   2. emojis don't work by default, install and run ~emojify-mode~
      - forgot that you need to install ~emojify~ (which I had) but also
        manually run it to actually display them (or enable them globally).
** gpg and ssh
   1. ssh
      - don't yell at me i know that it's probably not the best thing that I do
        this, but in my personal defense it is only for personal projects and my
        own servers
      - say you have an ssh key you would like to use on your new install:
        1. first, install ~openssh~
        2. execute the following:
           #+BEGIN_SRC sh
             mkdir ~/.ssh
             cp <private key> ~/.ssh/<private key>
             cp <public key> ~/.ssh/<public key>.pub
             chmod 700 ~/.ssh
             chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<private key>
             chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<public key>.pub
           #+END_SRC
   2. gpg
      1. install gpg
         - should already be installed but yeah
      2. import the key:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
           gpg --import <gpg key>

** AUR and aurman
   - AUR is the Arch User Repository, and it holds a bunch of additional
     packages that pacman does not have (or customized in different ways, etc).
   - ~aurman~ is a AUR Helper, a tool that helps to install packages hosted up
     on AUR
     - it is really good to look into how AUR works and how to do AUR installs
       on your own for the sake of being able to help yourself when something
       breaks, etc
   - to install ~aurman~:
     - first, we need to install the PGP key of the author:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         curl -sSL https://github.com/polygamma.gpg | gpg --import -
       #+END_SRC
       - this simply downloads the author's key and imports it directly into
         your GPG keychain
     - now install ~aurman~
       - it is common advise to make a specific directory where you can go
         download and install your AUR packages, so:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       mkdir ~/aur_pkg
       cd aur_pkg
       git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aurman.git
       cd aurmen/
       makepkg -si # DO NOT USE SUDO HERE
     #+END_SRC
   - to search for a package on AUR and install, it is just like with pacman:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       aurman -Ss <query> # search
       aurman -S <pkg> # install
     #+END_SRC
     - pls go see how it works in its totality: https://github.com/polygamma/aurman
       - make sure to checkout the install scripts/configs you are using
       - some malware was recently discovered on AUR
       - this should not be surprising: bad people are everywhere and the arch
         community has been saying for years to make sure to check the code
         you use before compiling it on your system
       - not your mom, tho, help the CCP or NSA run botnets for all i care man
     - example, I use [[https://spideroak.com/one/][spideroak one]] as private, encrypted, and more
       trustworthy dropbox service, and there is a maintained AUR install for
       it:
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         aurman -S spideroak-one # ta-da
       #+END_SRC
* other tweaks and lenovo x1c6 stuff
  this stuff is mostly related to lenovo thinkpads, but the ssd trimming and
  hibernate support are applicable to anyone, and i'm sure figuring out how to
  flash a bios could be useful to others.
** cpu throttling
   - cpu throttling
     - so turns out there is some unfortunate fuckery with Lenovo thinkpad
       cpu's right now
       - artificially throttled while underload because of misaligned temp
         values
     - lets install a script that fixes this
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         aurman -S lenovo-throttling-fix-git
         sudo systemctl enable --now lenovo_fix.service
       #+END_SRC
       - usual warnings apply about this not being endorsed by lenovo, etc etc
       - lenovo i love you, please stop hurting us like this
       - please look at the script yourself, see the options you have: https://github.com/erpalma/lenovo-throttling-fix
** bios update
   Lenovo has released an updated bio since (i'm guessing) most x1c6 units
   shipped, at least my model for sure.
     - has several improvements that are honestly worth risking a manual bios
       update
     - recall that disclaimer I had at the beginning? this action, more than
       anything, requires it
       - *you are responsible* for the result of updating your bios. *i am not*.
     - to update your bios:
       1. first go get the update, [[https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/n23ur08w.iso][here]].
       2. install the following utility made just for this:
         #+BEGIN_SRC sh
           aurman -S geteltorito
         #+END_SRC
       3. we now will extract the .img from the .iso that Lenovo provided us:
          #+BEGIN_SRC sh
            geteltorito.pl -o <image>.img <image>.iso
          #+END_SRC
          - where the ~.img~ is our *output* from extracting. Do not mix this up later.
            - i say this because when i was doing this myself at like 1am, i sure
              as hell did for a while and wasted 30 mins trying to figure out why
              my stupid update wouldn't initiate upon boot
       4. now we will make a live usb with the ~.img~
          - this is just like what we did when we made the arch live usb
            - same disclaimers apply: do not mix up your source with your
              destination, and double check the name of your drive with ~lsblk~
            - i will assume the device is named ~sdb~ for the purpose of this
              tutorial
            - make sure the drive is not mounted as well
          - with a spare usb you are okay with completely wiping clean, do the
            following:
            #+BEGIN_SRC sh
              dd if=/path/to/bios.img of=/dev/sdb bs=512K status=progress
            #+END_SRC
       5. now, with our new live-usb in hand, reboot the laptop and boot into the
          usb
          - you may first need to go back into bios and move the usb to the top
            of the boot order config like we needed to when installing arch
       6. once booted into the usb, *choose option #2*.
          - agree to all the disclaimers, make sure your *laptop is plugged
            in*, and wait for the update to work itself out.
          - if you would like a video of what this process visually looks like, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEcASjftccE][here ya go]]
** trimming SSD
   - not lenovo exclusive but /shrug/
     - "trimming" your ssd regularly improves its performance by allowing it
       to better know where it has memory free to use
   - make sure you can do it with command ~lsblk --discard~
     - non-zero values in the first and second column for your SSD means yes
   - if so, now install ~utils-linux~ and enable the service for periodic
     trimming
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       pacman -S utils-linux
       systemctl enable fstrim.timer
     #+END_SRC
     - you can tweak the time interval this occurs, that's on you
   - for those possibly wondering: we don't need to enable trimming in lvm's
     conf nor for dm-crypt with this method, which is both nice and more
     secure. That said, you could potentially get better performance doing
     these alterations as well, but I won't.
** hibernate support
   1. we need to change our HOOKS in ~/etc/mkinitcpio.conf~ once more:
      - we are adding the ~resume~ argument *between* lvm2 and filesystems
        #+BEGIN_SRC conf
          HOOKS=(base udev autodetect keyboard keymap modconf block encrypt lvm2 resume filesystems fsck)
        #+END_SRC
   2. we need to regenerate our ~initramfs~ once again:
      - if you installed ~linux-lts~, you need to do this for that as well.
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          mkinitcpio -p linux
          # mkinitcpio -p linux-lts
        #+END_SRC        
   3. we now need to edit our ~arch.conf~ loader so it knows we have access to
      hibernation
      - tweaking the kernel parameters in ~options~ by adding
        ~resume=/dev/mapper/main_group-swap~, or whatever the path is for your
        encrypted swap partition in ~/dev/mapper/~ is.
      - example, near the end of the last line:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
          title Arch Linux
          linux /vmlinuz-linux
          initrd /intel-ucode.img
          initrd /initramfs-linux.img
          options cryptdevice=UUID=<LONG-ALPHANUM-STRING>:cryptlvm root=/dev/mapper/main_group-root resume=/dev/mapper/main_group-swap quiet rw
        #+END_SRC
** patching for S3 support
   1. s3 vs s0i3 sleep state
      - this is a lot trickier and i won't be walking you through this
      - tl;dr, MCSFT is pushing a new sleep state standard, s0i3, that makes laptop behave more
        akin to phones
        - pros: they can do stuff like connect to wifi, update, and refresh
          user data while asleep
        - cons: massively more energy use
      - lenovo decided to support this: okay, fine
        - ... but also decided to completely remove support for previous
          format, S3
          - wait, *why, lenovo, why??????*
      - Making matters worse: neither are now properly supported by linux
        because of lenovo's implementation, you need to apply a patch fix
        either way
        - it involves patching the kernal or editing boot configs
        - didn't mention them earlier because this is an idiot's guide and i
          didn't want to overwhelm you
          - i was also overwhelmed, i was the idiot
      - reference the wiki, make your decision:
        - if you want to return to S3, follow this guide: https://delta-xi.net/#056
        - it is very good and really does guide you through all the steps, do
          not be intimidated
   2. if you follow the s3 guide (as I did), some advice:
      1. *first and foremost, update your bios as described above*
         1. good chance your s3 won't work nearly as good without it (if at
            all, going by forum discussions)
      2. when running the patch, Hunk 7 failed for me.
         1. solution: there is a function call that will look like this in
            your .dsl:
            #+BEGIN_SRC asm
              OperationRegion (GNVS, SystemMemory, 0x4FF4E000,0x0771)
            #+END_SRC
            - the last two values are different from the ~.patch~ the author
              provides. Edit the values *in the patch* to be the *same* as
              those in your *.dsl*
            - after this, *regenerate* the .dsl as the author guides you and
              reapply the patch as instructed, hunk 7 should now pass.
         2. the author uses ~GRUB~, if you followed my guide, you don't use
            ~GRUB~ like me.
            1. Follow the guide as instructed up to, and including, to where
               we ~cp~ the ~acpi_override~ to ~/boot/~
            2. Now we need to edit our ~arch.conf~ entry that we made earlier
               in ~/boot/loader/entries/~
               - we are making two additions, adding a ~initrd /acpi_override~
                 entry and then adding another kernal param argument to
                 options, ~mem_sleep_default=deep~
               - this is what my ~arch.conf~ looks like:
                 #+BEGIN_SRC conf
                   title Arch Linux
                   linux /vmlinuz-linux
                   initrd /intel-ucode.img
                   initrd /acpi_override
                   initrd /initramfs-linux.img
                   options cryptdevice=UUID=<LONG-ALPHANUM-STRING>:cryptlvm root=/dev/mapper/main_group-root mem_sleep_default=deep quiet rw
                 #+END_SRC
                 - notice the fourth line and the end of the last line, you'll
                   see my edits as compared to when we first made this file
                 - I've excluded the edit for enabling hibernation from this
                   example, fyi
   3. update: there is a script to do this if you feel comfortable using it!
      - look [[https://github.com/fiji-flo/x1carbon2018s3][here]]
